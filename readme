JSON Backend to store the Comic collection from Comic Keeper


The structure of the db.json is having 2 main objects:

Collection: To store/delete all the Comics added to user's collection.
Wishlist: To store/delete all the Comics added to users wishes.

Both are updated through the Posts in ComicsPage and Deleted in MyPage.
